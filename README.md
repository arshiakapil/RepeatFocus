# READme

RepeatFocus is a k-mer filteringâ€“based pipeline designed to enrich repeat-containing reads prior to assembly. I aim to evaluate whether selectively assembling repeat-enriched reads improves the recovery of repetitive sequences, particularly in terms of contiguity and completeness, when working with low-coverage long-read datasets.
