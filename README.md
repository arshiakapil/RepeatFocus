# README

  The goal of this project is to evaluate the recovery of repetitive sequences from low coverage datasets by developing a reproducible k-mer based filtering pipeline, RepeatFocus. The pipeline is implemented using a Nextflow v24.04.4.5917[11] system to ensure scalability, portability, and reproducibility across computing environments.

# Overview 
*RepeatFocus* is a k-mer filteringâ€“based pipeline designed to enrich repeat-containing reads prior to assembly. I aim to evaluate whether selectively assembling repeat-enriched reads improves the recovery of repetitive sequences, particularly in terms of contiguity and completeness, when working with low-coverage long-read datasets.

> ***Figure 1:*** This figure outlines the RepeatFocus pipeline for assembling repetitive regions from low-coverage long-read sequencing data. (1) Raw long reads are processed with Meryl to generate a k-mer frequency database. (2) A statistical threshold is calculated to identify high-frequency, potentially repetitive k-mers. (3) A filtered k-mer database is created containing only k-mers above this threshold. (4) Reads containing these, more than 50% repetitive k-mers are extracted from the original dataset. (5) The extracted reads are assembled using Hifiasm. (6) Assembly quality is assessed using metrics that evaluate continuity, correctness, and completeness, with a focus on the recovery of repetitive sequences.

# WorkFlow
1. PreProcessing and Optimization: Create a kmer spectra to identify repetitive kmers which are used to filter the reads based on repetitivness used for assembly.
2. Assembly: Filtered reads are assembled using a long read assembler Hifiasm.
3. Evaluation: Assembly and Validation metrics are calculated to assess the accuracy of the assembly and the recovery of repetitive content.

# Prerequisites and Setup
This workflow requires the installation of several software packages. We have created a configuration file(yml) that can be activated using conda. Since Nextflow has been selected as the workflow management system, its installation is required prior to running the RepeatFocus pipeline. 
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
If required, these are the necessary packages that can be installed directly on your computer:

```
 conda install -c conda-forge r-base
 conda install bioconda::meryl
 conda install bioconda::hifiasm
```

# Running
Run nextflow on the command line with the -with-conda and -with-report features to ensure smooth running of the pipeline and to create assembly metrics in the <usage file> specified by you.
```
nextflow run long_read.nf -with-conda -with-report <input directory> <usage file>
```
